In the ancient halls of Athens, Plato and Aristotle engage in a spirited debate on the nature of consent. 
Plato, drawing from his theory of forms, argues that true consent can only emerge from a rational understanding of the Good. 
He contends that individuals must be enlightened through education to make genuine consensual choices.

Aristotle, ever the empiricist, counters with a more practical view. 
He maintains that consent arises from the natural social relationships between individuals, emphasizing the importance of 
practical wisdom (phronesis) in making informed decisions. While acknowledging the role of reason, he argues that consent 
is fundamentally rooted in human experience and social context.

Their debate echoes through time, influencing modern discussions on autonomy, ethics, and human relationships. 
Plato's idealistic vision of informed consent through philosophical enlightenment contrasts with Aristotle's more grounded 
approach based on practical wisdom and social realities.
